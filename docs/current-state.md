## Last Updated

- **Date and time:** 2026-07-06 13:48:00 (UTC+02:00)
- **Current phase:** **Phase 4 — slice 1 complete, proceeding to slice 2**
- **Active change:** none (slice `add-identity-and-access` archived)
- **Progress:** Phase 4 retrofit evidence for slice 1 is in place: OpenSpec change docs, backend unit tests for JWT/validation/entity defaults, frontend page render tests for `/login` and `/register`, and inline auth review evidence. Frontend battery passes locally. Backend Maven validation remains blocked in this environment by Maven Central PKIX certificate resolution before Spring or PostgreSQL startup.
- **Next task:** Continue Phase 4 with slice 2 `add-personal-archive`, carrying forward the same review → validation → archive flow.

## OpenSpec Status

```

Archived changes:

- `2026-07-06-add-identity-and-access` — Phase 4 retrofit validation completed and archived.

## Completed Changes

### 1. `add-identity-and-access`

Status: archived.
Implemented:
- Existing auth slice documented in OpenSpec for FR-AUTH-01–05 and FR-SHELL-01–04.
- Backend unit coverage added for JWT generation/expiry, registration DTO validation, and user entity defaults.
- Frontend render coverage added for `/login` and `/register`.
- Inline review completed; permissive CORS credentials setting removed from the backend security config.
Smoke test:
- Frontend validation battery passed locally.
- Backend Maven test execution is blocked here by PKIX dependency-resolution failures against Maven Central, so real-DB smoke must run in a repaired Java/Maven environment or Docker image with trusted certificates.
Latest checks:
- `firefly-fe`: lint passed with 1 existing warning, tests passed (2 files / 5 tests), build passed.
- `firefly-be`: `.\mvnw.cmd test` and targeted unit-test execution both blocked by PKIX certificate validation before dependency download.

## Validation Commands

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test:run
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
npm run build
npx openspec validate --all --strict
```

Current test expectation: `firefly-fe` test/lint/build are green locally. `firefly-be` now has committed auth unit tests, but Maven execution remains blocked in this environment until certificate trust is repaired.

## Environment / Deployment

- `firefly-be` expects PostgreSQL via `DB_URL`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, uploads via `UPLOAD_DIR`, and JWT via `JWT_SECRET`.
- Frontend Docker deployment now expects nginx on port `80`, proxies `/api` and `/uploads` to the `backend` service, and allows request bodies up to `10m` for memory photo uploads.
- {{Secrets live in .env.local — never print or commit}}

## Agent Rules / Gotchas

- `firefly-be` targets Spring Boot 4.1.0, Kotlin 2.3.21, Java 25, and Jakarta namespaces (`jakarta.*` only).
- Maven dependency resolution currently fails with `PKIX path building failed` against Maven Central in this environment.
- Backend validation therefore cannot yet reach Spring context startup or PostgreSQL-dependent tests from this shell.
- {{OS/shell quirks}}
- Do not archive OpenSpec changes before implementation and smoke test.
